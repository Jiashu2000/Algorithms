# Sliding Window

- Fixed-size sliding window:
    the size of the window is fixed. we move the window by one position at a time.
    this is often used to perform operations like finding the maximum or minimum value in a subarray of fixed size.

- Variable-size sliding window:
    the size of the window changes dynamically, depending on problem constraints. 
    this technique is often used to perform operations like find the maximum or minimum subarray whose sum
    is greater than or equal to a certain value.
