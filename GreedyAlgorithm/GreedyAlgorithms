# Greedy Algorithms

Greedy Algorithm:
    a method for solving optimization problems by taking decisions that result in the most
    evident and immediate benefit irrespective of the final outcome.

Use of Greedy Algorithm:
    - Scheduling and Resource Allocation
    - Minimum Spanning Trees
    - Coin Change Problem

Algorithms
    - Kruskal's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
    - Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
    - Dijkstra's Shortest Path
